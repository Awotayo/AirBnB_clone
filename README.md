#AirBnB Clone

# Description of the project
# The Console

This is the first step towards building full web application: the AirBnB clone
The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine. it's first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI that will be built later

* create data model <br />
* manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter <br/>
* store and persist objects to a file (JSON file) Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances <br />
